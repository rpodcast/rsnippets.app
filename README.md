# Residual Snippets Shiny App

<!-- badges: start -->

[![Lifecycle:

<!-- badges: end -->

**Residual Snippets** is an informal, unedited, and free-flowing audio
series from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast). If you enjoy
hearing quick takes from a data scientist on their journey to blend
innovative uses of open-source technology, contributing back to their
brilliant communities, and juggling the curveballs life throws at them,
this series is for you\!

This repository contains the code behind the Residual Snippets Shiny
application. It is my first forray into creating a mobile style
application, but it is now possible thanks to the excellent
[`shinyMobile`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/index.html)
package written by **David Granjon**
([`@divadnojnarg`](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg)), which powers this
application’s UI\!
