**Residual Snippets** is an informal, unedited, and free-flowing audio
series from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast). If you enjoy
hearing quick takes from a data scientist on their journey to blend
innovative uses of open-source technology, contributing back to their
brilliant communities, and juggling the curveballs life throws at them,
this series is for you\!

You can view the hosted version of the application at
[rpodcast.shinyapps.io/rsnippets](https://rpodcast.shinyapps.io/rsnippets)

This repository contains the code behind the Residual Snippets Shiny
application. It is my first forray into creating a mobile style
application, but it is now possible thanks to these excellent
contributions in the Shiny
    community:

  - [`{shinyMobile}`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/index.html)
    package written by **David Granjon**
    ([`@divadnojnarg`](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg)), which powers
    this application’s UI\!
  - **Athos Petri Damiani**
    ([`@athos_damiani`](https://twitter.com/athos_damiani)) authored an
    excellent R package
    [`{wavesurfer}`](https://github.com/Athospd/wavesurfer) that wraps
    the [`wavesurfer.js`](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) JavaScript
    library, enabling this application to play the **Residual Snippet**
    episodes\!
  - [`{golem}`](https://thinkr-open.github.io/golem/) by
    [ThinkR](https://thinkr.fr/) which enables me to create an R pakage
    infrastructure around this application and utilize best practices in
    development.
