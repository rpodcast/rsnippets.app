# Residual Snippets Shiny App

<!-- badges: start -->

**Residual Snippets** is an informal, unedited, and free-flowing audio series from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast).  If you enjoy hearing quick takes from a data scientist on their journey to blend innovative uses of open-source technology, contributing back to their brilliant communities, and juggling the curveballs life throws at them, this series is for you!

This repository contains the code behind the Residual Snippets Shiny application. It is my first forray into creating a mobile style application, but it is now possible thanks to these excellent contributions in the Shiny community:

* [`shinyMobile`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/index.html) package written by __David Granjon__ ([`@divadnojnarg`](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg)), which powers this application's UI!
* __Athos Petri Damiani__ ([`@athos_damiani`](https://twitter.com/athos_damiani)) authored an excellent R package [`wavesurfer`](https://github.com/Athospd/wavesurfer) that wraps the [`wavesurfer.js`](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) JavaScript library, enabling this application to play the __Residual Snippet__ episodes!

You can view the hosted version of the application at [rpodcast.shinyapps.io/rsnippets](https://rpodcast.shinyapps.io/rsnippets)
