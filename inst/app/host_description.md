Eric Nantz ([`@thercast`](https://twitter.com/thercast)) is a statistician / data scientist / developer who greatly enjoys the vast, exciting world of open-source and applying analytics to interesting data sets in new ways. Once he discovered the fascinating worlds of Linux and the R language in graduate school, it was a game-changer to say the least. 

Drawing inspiration from excellent content creators like [Jupiter Broadcasting](https://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/), he launched the [R-Podcast](https://r-podcast.org/) as a way to highlight innovative uses of the R language in a wide variety of fields and to share the stories of influential members of the R and data science communities. More recently, Eric partnered with [RStudio](https://rstudio.com) to create the [Shiny Developer Series](https://shinydevseries.com) for sharing advice on building [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com) applications from brillliant developers and practioners.
