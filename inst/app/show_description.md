**Residual Snippets** is an informal, unedited, and free-flowing audio series from [Eric Nantz](https://github.com/rpodcast).  If you enjoy hearing quick takes from a data scientist on their journey to blend innovative uses of open-source technology, contributing back to their brilliant communities, and juggling the curveballs life throws at them, this series is for you!

### Acknowledgements

I have been wanting to produce something like this for a long time, and I've been able to finally pull it off thanks to massive advancements in key open-source projects, innovative backend services, and excellent ideas / resources from the community.  In no particular order:

* __Alan Pope__ ([`@popey`](https://twitter.com/popey)) is a developer advocate at Canonical as well as a highly entertaining podcast host for the [Ubuntu Podcast](https://ubuntupodcast.org) and [Ask Error](https://error.show) shows. In 2019, he launched a new experiment called [Telecast with Popey](https://t.me/telecastwithpopey) where he uses voice memos recorded on Telegram to distribute short podcast-like episodes to his community.  View more background on [this post](https://twitter.com/popey/status/1160170988283338752).
* [__Mark Richman__](https://linuxacademy.com/blog/behind-the-scenes/employee-spotlight-mark-richman/) (training architect at [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com)) authored an excellent course on automating AWS Lambda workflows that integrate with other AWS services (such as speech transcription and media transcoding) with python and the boto3 module. I was able to adapt many of the course examples to power the backend of __Residual Snippets!__
* __David Granjon__ ([`@divadnojnarg`](https://twitter.com/divadnojnarg)) has authored many excellent R packages to supercharge [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) application user interfaces and workflows, including [`shinyMobile`](https://rinterface.github.io/shinyMobile/index.html) which powers this application's UI!
* __Athos Petri Damiani__ ([`@athos_damiani](https://twitter.com/athos_damiani)) authored an excellent R package [`wavesurfer`](https://github.com/Athospd/wavesurfer) that wraps the [`wavesurfer.js`](https://wavesurfer-js.org/) JavaScript library, enabling this application to play the __Residual Snippet__ episodes!
